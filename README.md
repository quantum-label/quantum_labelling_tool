## Introduction

The **QUANTUM Data Quality Labelling Tool** is a key component of the **European Health Data Space (EHDS)** initiative, designed to address the challenge of ensuring that health datasets are of high quality, accessible, and interoperable across EU member states. As healthcare data plays an increasingly vital role in research, policy, and innovation, this tool provides a standardized mechanism to evaluate and label the **quality, utility, and maturity** of datasets, supporting stakeholders such as healthcare institutions, research organizations, and policymakers.

## Features

This tool empowers **data holders** by offering functionalities to:

- **Feature 1:** Catalogue and Dataset metadata creation
- **Feature 2:** Assess datasets quality based on a guided evaluation of the QUANTUM key dimensions (such as accuracy, accessibility, and compliance) using your own practices.
- **Feature 3:** Generate and visualise data quality certificates (labels) and download them in the HealthData@EU standardized RDF format.
- **Feature 4:** Facilitate compliance with EU-wide quality standards such as [HealthDCAT-AP](https://healthdcat-ap.github.io/), [DCAT](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/), [DQV](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dqv/).
- **Feature 5:** Provide a transparent and accessible method for assessing data holders maturity.

Ultimately, the QUANTUM tool aims to foster **trust in health data** across Europe by promoting reliable, reusable datasets that can be confidently shared within the European Health Data Space.

## System Requirements
### Minimum Hardware Requirements
- CPU: 1 core
- RAM: 1 GB
- Storage: 5 GB
### Recommended Hardware Requirements
- CPU: 2 to 4 cores
- RAM: 2 to 4 GB
- Storage: 10 to 20 GB
### Software Requirements
- Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS or similar
- Python 3.11
- Docker 24.0.2 (if used)


## Installation steps

```bash
git clone [repository_url]
cd [repository_directory]
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate # if database is not generated previously 
python manage.py createsuperuser # for creating root user if desired (current root user is root for username and password)
```

## Execution

```bash
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

- Access localhost:8000 through web browser
- Access localhost:8000/admin to visit the Admin dashboard (login is root for user and password by default)
- To register a user it is needed to 1) create the user, 2) create an organization, 3) relate a user with an organization (userorganization)

## Dockerizing

- Download the repository. When unzipped, the folder will be named "quantum_labelling_tool"
- For Dockerizing create a folder called "QUANTUM" where needed
- Inside QUANTUM create the folder "online_quantum_tool", which will contain the django web app.
- From "quantum_labelling_tool" copy the following files and folders to the "QUANTUM/online_quantum_tool" folder:
  - code
  - quantum
  - static
  - staticfiles
  - templates
  - webapp
  - manage.py
- Copy the content of "quantum_labelling_tool/docker" inside "QUANTUM" (keep in mind that it contains an .env file, which may be hidden)
- In the "QUANTUM" folder execute by bash:
```bash
docker build -t quantum_online_tool .
```
- When the image is built execute the docker-compose command inside the "QUANTUM" folder:
```bash
docker-compose up
```
- Access the web app container through the following command:
```
docker exec -it quantumtoolwebapp bash
```
- Fill the database with the initial information:
```
python manage.py migrate
```
- Create a superuser to play with (root):
```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

- Exit from the container
```
exit
```

- Access the database container:
```
docker exec -it quantumtooldatabase bash
```

- Execute the following commands to add information to the database
```
mysql -u root -p
use quantum;
source /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql;
```
